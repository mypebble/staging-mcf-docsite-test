                                        <h1>Managing Accounts</h1>
                                        <p>All the functions for setting up <span class="Name">Accounts</span> in Fund Manager are on the <span class="Name">Administration</span> Tab and the details of some accounts may have been added during your Set Up.  Other Accounts can be added as and when required.</p>
                                        <p>There are three sections, <span class="Name">Manage Account</span>, <span class="Name">Manage Bank Accounts</span> and <span class="Name">Manage Ledger Codes</span>.</p>
                                        <p>An <span class="Name">Account</span> is equivalent to an individual column header in a manual ledger. Accounts can be created at any time.  There is no effective limit to the number of Accounts you may have, but each one must have its own unique Code.</p>
                                        <p>The Account Code is a combination of between 1 and 6 letters and numbers.  Once saved, a code and an account name can be edited but can never be deleted; Instead Accounts are taken ‘Out of Use’ when you have no further need of them.  This prevents them from appearing on the transaction screens.  They may continue to appear on the report screens if they have a balance which is relevant to the open financial period.</p>
                                        <p>A <span class="Name">Bank Account</span> can be any account held with a bank that is used for the purposes of managing your Fund, eg current account, Savings accounts etc.</p>
                                        <p>The <span class="Name">Ledger Codes</span> option is available for providing exports into other finance packages to allow you to continue providing unified reports (eg VAT reporting), whilst gaining the benefits of Fund Manager's superior transaction entry. Set up your ledger codes in Fund Manager to match the Ledger codes in your external finance package. Then you can assign debit and credit entries to the correct ledgers to make accounting easier (e.g. grouping all trip transactions etc).</p>
                                        <h4>To view and edit your Accounts;</h4>
                                        <p>On the <span class="Name">Dashboard</span> (Organisation Summary) &gt;  <span class="Name">Accounts</span></p>
                                        <p>OR</p>
                                        <p>Go to  <span class="Name">Administration	&gt; Manage Accounts</span></p>

If you create additional Bank Accounts you can set up the Opening Balance in the Manage Bank Accounts tab (above).

                                        <p>You will need to close down your Fund Manager at some point after your Period End.</p>
                                        <p>Once the end date for your financial period has passed you can perform a Period End Closedown in Fund Manager that will draw a line under your transactions and allow you to produce the necessary reports to submit to your auditor.</p>
                                        <p>The objective of a closedown is to:</p>

                                        <p>During the Period End Closedown, Fund Manager will automatically carry forward your account closing balances and present them as the opening balances in the next period</p>
                                        <p>Once you select 'Confirm' your system is locked down into a draft close down, this is not fully closed and may be undone at any time. However, your transactions are moved into an archive state. Once your auditors have fully agreed and signed off your paper work, you may then close down your system completely.</p>
