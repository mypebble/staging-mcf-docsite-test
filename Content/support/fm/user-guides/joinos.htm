                                        <p>Before any parent/carer/ staff member can pay for an offer, they should first be registered on the system.</p>
                                        <p>The student’s Joinos code is then created and given to the Parent/ Carer / Staff member to activate.  Once this is done these Students/Staff can then receive offers about items that can be purchased online using Joinos.</p>
                                        <p>There are three tabs which are used to designate the stages of registration.  These are <span class="Name">Create Joinos Codes</span>, <span class="Name">Joinos Codes</span> and <span class="Name">Manage Connections</span>.</p>
                                        <p><span class="Name">Create Joinos Codes</span> - This show all the students/staff who are waiting to be registered on Joinos, this includes all new Students/Staff at the School or those who have never been registered.</p>
                                        <p>There is a Show Registered button on this tab and clicking on this will show not only those Students and Staff who have not been registered, but also all who have been registered but have not been activated and those who have an active connection to Joinos due to the Parent/Carer/Staff member logging onto Joinos and activating the Joinos Code.</p>
                                        <p><span class="Name">Joinos Codes</span> - These are all the Students/Staff who have had a Joinos Code created with the Creation and Expiry Date and who have not yet been activated in Joinos.  </p>

Any codes not activated within that time will expire and a new code will need to be created as and when necessary.</p>
                                        <p><span class="Name">Manage Connections</span> - these are all the Students/Staff who have been registered and are active within Joinos.</p>
                                        <h4>To Register Students/Staff</h4>
                                        <p>Click on <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Create Joinos Codes</span> and filter for the name required.</p>
                                        <p>If you can't find them in the list click the Show Registered button and they should appear in there.</p>
                                        <p>Click on the Tick box to the left of the name and click <span class="Name">Create Joinos Codes</span> button</p>

                                        <p>Their name will now disappear from the Create Joinos Codes tab and a message will appear at the top of the screen to say that “Your Joinos Codes have been created”.  You can create more than one code at a time by clicking on the tick box and the names will appear in the white box on the right side of the screen.</p>
                                        <p>Click on the <span class="Name">Joinos Codes</span> tab and their name should be showing with the code.  An example letter for sending the information for parents should have been given to you during your training.  There is also one attached to this User Guide at <a href="#Step11" class="selected">Appendix A</a>.</p>
                                        <p><span class="Emphasis">Issue:</span> If a parent can’t see their child in Joinos, this is most likely caused by the Joinos code which, if not used, will expire after three months.  With regard to the children whose Joinos codes have expired, you will need to recreate their Joinos codes and then inform the parents to use this new code.</p>
                                        <h4>Cancelling a Joinos Code</h4>
                                        <p>Sometimes it is necessary to cancel a Joinos code and to do this go to <span class="Name">Administration &gt; Manage Connections</span></p>
                                        <p>Find the name you wish to cancel the connection on and when open click <span class="Name">Remove</span> under the Disconnect Column</p>
